# cracking_work
A simple python programme to crack a sha512 hash, made as a school project at Copenhagen School of Design and Technology (KEA), fall semester 2022. The programme takes in a hash, a salt and the number of digits of the password to try and crack it. It is a simple brute-force strategy that tries combinations untill it gets the correct result. 

Note that the programme as it is now prints the incorrect passwords to the console - this is completely unnecessary and slows the programme down, it just looks cool.
